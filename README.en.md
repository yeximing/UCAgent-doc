# UCAgent (UnityChip verification Agent)

AI Agent for Automated Unit Test Verification Based on Large Language Models

[中文介绍](/README.zh.md)
[UCAgent Online Documentation](https://open-verify.cc/mlvp/en/docs/ucagent/)

## Project Overview

UCAgent is an automated hardware verification AI agent based on large language models, specifically focused on unit testing verification of chip designs. This project uses AI technology to automatically analyze hardware designs, generate test cases, execute verification tasks, and generate test reports, thereby improving verification efficiency.

**Key Focus Areas of This Project:**

- Automation of chip verification workflows
- Completeness of functional coverage and code coverage
- Consistency between documentation, code, and reports

UCAgent provides comprehensive Agent-to-LLM interaction logic, supports three intelligent modes (standard, enhanced, advanced), and integrates rich file operation tools for direct interaction with large language models through standardized APIs. Based on the Picker & Toffee framework, chip verification is essentially equivalent to software testing. **Therefore, existing programming-focused AI Agents (such as OpenHands, Copilot, Claude Code, Gemini-CLI, Qwen-Code, etc.) can achieve deep collaboration with UCAgent through the MCP protocol, realizing better verification results and higher levels of automation.**

#### UCAgent Input and Output

```bash
ucagent <workspace> <dut_name>
```

**Input:**

- `workspace:` Working directory:
  - `workspace/<DUT_DIR>:` Design Under Test (DUT), which is the Python package `<DUT_DIR>` exported by picker, for example: Adder
  - `workspace/<DUT_DIR>/README.md:` Verification requirements and objectives for the DUT described in natural language
  - `workspace/<DUT_DIR>/*.md:` Other reference files
  - `workspace/<DUT_DIR>_RTL/*.v/sv/scala:` Source files for bug analysis
  - Other verification-related files (e.g., provided test instances, requirement specifications, etc.)
- `dut_name:` Name of the design under test, i.e., `<DUT_DIR>`

**Output:**

- `workspace/Guide_Doc:` Various requirements and guidance documents followed during the verification process
- `workspace/uc_test_report:` Generated Toffee-test test reports
- `workspace/unity_test/tests:` Automatically generated test cases
- `workspace/*.md:` Generated various documents, including bug analysis, checkpoint records, verification plans, verification conclusions, etc.

### System Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Supported operating systems: Linux, macOS
- Memory: 4GB or more recommended
- Network: Requires access to AI model APIs (OpenAI compatible)
- picker: https://github.com/XS-MLVP/picker

### Quick Start

1. Download source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XS-MLVP/UCAgent.git
cd UCAgent
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Compile DUT, using the Adder example (requires [picker](https://github.com/XS-MLVP/picker))

```bash
make init_Adder
```

4. Start MCP-Server, default address: http://127.0.0.1:5000

```bash
make mcp_Adder # workspace is set to the output directory under current directory
```

5. Install and configure Qwen Code CLI

Please refer to: [https://qwenlm.github.io/qwen-code-docs/en/](https://qwenlm.github.io/qwen-code-docs/en/)

Since test cases may take longer to run when there are many of them, it's recommended to set a larger `timeout` value, such as 10 seconds. Example Qwen configuration file:

`~/.qwen/settings.json` configuration file:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"unitytest": {
			"httpUrl": "http://localhost:5000/mcp",
			"timeout": 10000
		}
	}
}
```

6. Start verification

```bash
cd output
qwen
```

Note: The Code Agent must be launched within the working directory (e.g., the output directory in the example above), otherwise file path mismatches may occur.

**Input task prompt:**

> Please use the `RoleInfo` tool to get your role information and basic guidance, then complete the task. Please use the `ReadTextFile` tool to read files. You need to perform file operations in the current working directory and do not go beyond this directory.

Hints:

- Please write a validation prompt according to the task requirements
- When the Code Agent stops halfway, you can enter prompts: `continue and use the tools Check and Complete to determine if all tasks have been completed`

### Common Operations

##### TUI shortcuts

- `ctrl + up/down/left/right`: Adjust UI layout
- `shift + up/down`: Adjust status panel height
- `shift + right`: Clear console
- `shift + left`: Clear input
- `esc`: Force refresh UI

##### Stage color hints

- `White`: Pending
- `Red`: Running
- `Green`: Passed
- `*`: Stage requires human check; run `hmcheck_pass [msg]` to continue
- `Yellow`: Skipped

##### Common interactive commands

- `q`: Exit TUI (or exit UCAgent)
- `tui`: Enter TUI
- `tab`: Command completion
- `tool_list`: List all available tools

### Usage Methods

#### 1. MCP-Server with Code Agent (Recommended)

This mode enables collaborative verification with all LLM clients that support MCP-Server calls, such as Cherry Studio, Claude Code, Gemini-CLI, VS Code Copilot, Qwen-Code, Qoder, etc.

When starting UCAgent, enable the corresponding service through `mcp-server` related parameters.

##### MCP Server Options

| Parameter                    | Description                                      | Default     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `--mcp-server`               | Start MCP server mode                            | -           |
| `--mcp-server-host`          | MCP server host address                          | `127.0.0.1` |
| `--mcp-server-port`          | MCP server port                                  | `5000`      |
| `--mcp-server-no-file-tools` | Start MCP Sever and disable file operation tools | -           |
| `--no-embed-tools`           | Disable embedded tools                           | -           |

Example:

```bash
ucagent output/ Adder --tui --mcp-server-no-file-tools --no-embed-tools
```

Parameter explanation:

- `--tui` Enable text user interface for displaying progress and command line interaction
- `--mcp-server-no-file-tools` Start MCP Sever and disable UCAgent's file editing tools, use Code Agent's built-in file tools
- `--no-embed-tools` Disable Embed-related tools (Code Agent has optimized similar tools for itself)

Recommended task startup prompt (without file tools, i.e., `--mcp-server-no-file-tools`):

> Please use the `RoleInfo` tool to get your role information and basic guidance, then complete the task. Please use the `ReadTextFile` tool to read files. You need to perform file operations in the current working directory and do not go beyond this directory.

Or (with file tools):

> Please use the `RoleInfo` tool to get your role information and basic guidance, then complete the task. Please use the `ReadTextFile` tool to read files and `EditTextFile` to create and edit files.

**Tip: Code Agents are optimized for their own models, so using them to drive UCAgent will achieve better verification results**

#### 2. Direct LLM Integration

Create and edit a `config.yaml` file to configure the AI model and embedding model:

```yaml
# API configuration (supports openai, anthropic, google_genai)
model_type: openai

# $(NAME: default_value): Read the environment variable NAME,
#    where default_value is the default value
openai:
  # Model Name
  model_name: "$(OPENAI_MODEL: <your_chat_model_name>)"
  # API Key
  openai_api_key: "$(OPENAI_API_KEY: your_api_key)"
  # API Basic URL
  openai_api_base: "$(OPENAI_API_BASE: http://<your_chat_model_url>/v1)"

# Vector embedding model configuration
#  Used for document search and memory functions,
#  can be turned off through '--no-embed-tools'
embed:
  # Embedded model name
  model_name: "$(EMBED_MODEL: <your_embedding_model_name>)"
  # Embedded Model API Key
  openai_api_key: "$(EMBED_OPENAI_API_KEY: [your_api_key])"
  # Embedded Model API URL
  openai_api_base: "$(EMBED_OPENAI_API_BASE: http://<your_embedding_model_url>/v1)"
  # Embedding dimensions, such as 4096
  dims: "$(EMBED_OPENAI_API_BASE: 4096)"
```

Example:

```bash
ucagent output/ Adder --config config.yaml -s -hm --tui -utt
```

##### Frequently used commands

- `ctrl+c`: Pause the current task
- `loop [prompt]`: Continue the current task

Please use the `help` command to view all supported interactive commands

### Human machine collaborative verification

UCAgent supports human-machine collaboration during the verification process, allowing users to pause AI execution, manually intervene in the verification process, and then continue AI execution. This mode is suitable for scenarios that require fine control or complex decision-making.

**Collaborative process:**

1. Pause AI execution:

- In direct access to LLM mode: Press `Ctrl+C` to pause.
- In Code Agent collaborative mode: pause according to the agent (e.g., Gemini‑CLI uses `Esc`).

2. Manual intervention:

- Manually edit files, test cases, or configurations.
- Use interactive commands for debugging or tuning.

3. Stage control:

- Use `tool_invoke Check` to check the current stage status.
- Use `tool_invoke Complete` to mark the completion of the stage and move on to the next stage.

4. Continue to execute:

- Use the `loop [prompt]` command to continue AI execution and provide additional prompt information.
- In Code Agent mode, input prompts through the Agent's console.

5. Permission management:

- File write permissions can be set using commands such as `add_un_write_path` and `del_un_write_path` to control whether AI can edit specific files.
- Suitable for direct access to LLM or mandatory use of UCAgent file tools.

Notes:

- The Human Check for the specified stage can be forcibly enabled using the command `hmcheck_set <stage_index> [true|false]`
- In the forced Human Check phase, manual approval is required by executing the command `hmcheck_pass [message]`
- For certain stages of the Checker, the forced Human Check can also be enabled via the parameter `need_human_check: true`

### Multi-language support for config and guide docs

At present, the repo only provides a Chinese version. If you need other languages, you can find the `lang_dir` directory through `ucagent --check`:

```bash
ucagent --check
UCAgent version: 0.9.2.dev363+g76f9f05f9
Check   sys_config      ~/python3.11/site-packages/vagent/setting.yaml   [Found]
Check   user_config     ~/.ucagent/setting.yaml [Found]
Check   lang_dir        ~/python3.11/site-packages/vagent/lang   [Found]
Check   'zh' config     ~/python3.11/site-packages/vagent/lang/zh/config/default.yaml    [Found]
Check   'zh' Guide_Doc  ~/python3.11/site-packages/vagent/lang/zh/doc/Guide_Doc  [Found]
Check   'zh' template   ~/python3.11/site-packages/vagent/lang/zh/template/unity_test    [Found]
```

Enter the `lang_dir` directory, copy via `cp -r zh en`, then translate into the target language, and finally set it in the configuration file:

```yaml
lang: "en"
```

Alternatively, by specifying parameters `--config`, `--template-dir`, `--guide-doc-path` to the target language file, a similar effect can be achieved.

### Documentation Build & Preview (MkDocs)

Makefile provides helper targets for docs (MkDocs + Material):

| Target              | Purpose                                              | When to Use                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `make docs-help`    | Show documentation-related targets help text         | View available commands             |
| `make docs-install` | Install build deps from `docs/requirements-docs.txt` | First time or deps update           |
| `make docs-serve`   | Local preview (default: 127.0.0.1:8030)              | When developing/previewing          |
| `make docs-build`   | Build static site into `docs/site`                   | Generate production version locally |
| `make docs-clean`   | Remove `docs/site` directory                         | When cleaning build artifacts       |

#### Usage Workflow

**First Time Setup (Install Dependencies):**

```bash
make docs-install    # Install mkdocs, material theme, and other dependencies
```

**Daily Development (Preview Docs):**

```bash
make docs-serve      # Start local server, visit http://127.0.0.1:8030 to view
# Browser auto-refreshes when you edit docs
```

**Local Generation (Build Production Version):**

```bash
make docs-build      # Generate static site to docs/site directory
# Open docs/site/index.html in your local browser to view
make docs-clean      # Clean build artifacts (optional)
```

#### Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Initial setup: Install dependencies
make docs-install

# 2. Development phase: Preview docs (can run repeatedly)
make docs-serve      # Visit http://127.0.0.1:8030 in browser
# ...edit docs...
# Press Ctrl+C to stop server

# 3. Local generation: Build production version
make docs-build      # Generate ./site directory
# Open ./site/index.html in your local browser to view

# 4. Cleanup (optional)
make docs-clean      # Remove ./site directory
```

#### Notes

- Host/port currently fixed in `docs/Makefile`; edit if you need different values.
- `make docs-serve` is for development use, supports hot reload
- `make docs-build` generates static files to docs/site; open docs/site/index.html locally

### PDF Manual Build (Pandoc + XeLaTeX)

High-quality PDF (developer manual) build rules:

| Target           | Purpose                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `make pdf`       | Build `ucagent-doc.pdf` from ordered markdown sources |
| `make pdf-one`   | Same as `pdf` (CI convenience wrapper)                |
| `make pdf-clean` | Remove generated PDF and LaTeX aux files              |

Examples:

```bash
make pdf
make MONO="JetBrains Mono" pdf       # override monospaced font
make TWOSIDE=1 pdf                    # two‑sided layout (filename adds -twoside)
make pdf-clean
```

Requirements: pandoc, XeLaTeX (TexLive) or Tectonic, Chinese font "Noto Serif CJK SC", monospaced font (default DejaVu Sans Mono), optional filter `pandoc-crossref`.

Customization vars:

- `MONO` override monospaced font.
- `TWOSIDE` non-empty enables two-sided layout.

Notes & Troubleshooting:

- CI uses Tectonic to auto-fetch LaTeX packages; locally the default engine is XeLaTeX. You can set `PDF_ENGINE=tectonic` when running `make` to use Tectonic locally.
- Missing font: install CJK fonts (e.g. `fonts-noto-cjk`).
- LaTeX errors: ensure XeLaTeX packages (or use Tectonic).
- Crossrefs missing: ensure `pandoc-crossref` in PATH.

Output file: `ucagent-doc.pdf` suitable for release distribution.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How to configure different AI models?**

**A:** Modify the `openai.model_name` field in `config.yaml`, supports any OpenAI-compatible API.

**Q: What to do when errors occur during verification?**

**A:** Use `Ctrl+C` to enter interactive mode, use `status` to check current status, and use `help` to get debugging commands.

**Q: Can verification stages be customized?**

**A:** Yes, you can customize the verification workflow by modifying the `stage` configuration in `vagent/lang/zh/config/default.yaml`. You can also override stage parameters directly in config.yaml.

**Q: How to add custom tools?**

**A:** Create new tool classes in the `vagent/tools/` directory, inherit from the `UCTool` base class, and load them through the `--ex-tools` parameter.

**Q: MCP server cannot connect?**

**A:** Check if the port is occupied, confirm firewall settings, and you can specify other ports through `--mcp-server-port`.

**Q: How to run long-term verification?**

**A:** Please refer to CodeAgent's headless mode and the script `tests/test_nohead_loop.bash`.

**Q: Why is there residual information from the last execution?**

**A:** By default, UCAgent reads `.ucagent_info.json` in the working directory to resume the last execution. If you don't need history, delete that file or pass `--no-history`.
